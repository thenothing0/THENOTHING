# Security Policy

## ⚠️ Responsible Use

HYDRA is designed **exclusively** for authorized security testing within approved bug bounty program scopes. 

**Unauthorized use of this tool against systems you do not have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.**

## 🔒 Scope Enforcement

HYDRA includes mandatory scope enforcement at three levels:
1. **Scope Intelligence Layer** — Blocks out-of-scope targets before any scan
2. **MCP Tool Server** — Validates every tool execution against scope policy
3. **Coordinator** — Blocks entire scan phases for unauthorized targets

These safety mechanisms should **never** be bypassed or disabled.
